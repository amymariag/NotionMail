Welcome to NotionMail!

NotionMail is a Node.js CLI that uses the Notion API to let you send, read and delete “mail” pages (with sender, recipient, message and timestamp properties) in your personal Notion database; it loops until you type exit so you can run multiple commands or retry invalid input.
